        "1. Python 3.10+.\n",
        "2. [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) installed and running locally with a model (e.g., `ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b`).\n",

        "3. Summarize findings.\n",

            "1. **Size**: Cats typically measure between 2 to 6 feet (0.5 to 1.5 meters) in height.\n",

            "\n",
            "3. **Behavior**: Cats are generally calm, affectionate, and social. They like company and often prefer to stand still when nearby. Cats may roll over on their back when they sleep.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Milk Production**: Some cats produce a lot of milk from their lips (bodily milk), which is used as a treat or milk drink.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Habitat**: Cats thrive in both indoor and outdoor environments, but indoor living can disrupt their natural behavior.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Breed Sizes:\n",
            "- **Common Breeds**: Golden Retriever, Siamese, Black Forest Cat are popular among the elderly.\n",

            "  - **Golden Retriever**: Can weigh up to 50 pounds (23 kg).\n",
            "  - **Siamese**: Typically around 10-14 inches (26-35 cm) in height and body weight.\n",

            "\n",
            "### Health Tips:\n",
            "- Cats require sufficient exercise, water, and sunlight. Avoid putting cats in containers without windows or doors.\n",
